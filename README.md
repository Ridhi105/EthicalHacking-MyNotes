Day 01: GitHub is a platform for hosting and collaborating on code using Git, a version control system. When you say you've learned the basics, it usually includes:

 1. What Git and GitHub Are

Git is a tool to track changes in your code. 

GitHub is a cloud-based platform to host Git repositories, collaborate with others, and manage projects. 

Think of Git as the engine and GitHub as the garage where you store and share your work.

 2. Creating a GitHub Account

You need an account to:

- Create and contribute to repositories
- Follow other developers
- Open issues and pull requests

 3. Understanding Repositories

A repository (repo) is like a folder that contains your project files, history, and settings. On GitHub, you can:

- Create a new repo
- Clone existing ones
- Fork other people's projects to modify them on your own

 4. Basic Git Commands

You likely learned some key commands used in the terminal or command line:

| Command                     | Purpose                                      |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| git init                    | Initialize a new Git repository              |
| git clone <url>            | Copy an existing repo from GitHub            |
| git add .                   | Stage changes for commit                      |
| git commit -m "message"    | Save changes with a message                  |
| git push                    | Upload changes to GitHub                     |
| git pull                    | Download the latest changes from GitHub      |

 5. Commits and Version History

Every time you save your changes with git commit, Git creates a version snapshot. 

GitHub displays these commits so you can track changes over time.

 6. Branches

Branches let you work on different features or experiments without affecting the main project. 

The default branch is usually main or master.

 7. Pull Requests (PRs)

When collaborating:

- You create a branch, make changes, and submit a pull request.

A PR lets others review and discuss your code before it merges into the main branch.

 Part 2: Exploring Repositories

Once you know the basics, exploring repositories means navigating, analyzing, and understanding existing projects on GitHub.

Day 02: 1. Downloaded and Installed VirtualBox

VirtualBox is a free tool from Oracle that lets you run other operating systems, like Kali Linux, inside your main OS, whether it's Windows or macOS.

It's useful for testing tools and environments safely without affecting your main system.

2. Downloaded Kali Linux (VirtualBox Version)

You downloaded the pre-built Kali Linux VirtualBox image from the official Kali website.

This version is set up to run directly in VirtualBox, eliminating the need to install it from scratch.

3. Installed 7-Zip to Extract Files

The Kali image comes as a compressed .7z file.

7-Zip is a free tool for extracting .7z files and other archive formats.

You used it to unpack the Kali VM files before importing them into VirtualBox.

4. Started Kali Linux Using the VM File

You opened VirtualBox, then imported and launched the Kali Linux VM.

This started a virtual machine, which acts like a computer within your computer, running Kali Linux.

5. Logged in with Default Credentials

Kali Linux has a default username and password:

Username: kali

Password: kali

You used these to log into the system and access the Kali Linux desktop.

Day 03: Common Kali Linux Tools (High-Level Overview)

Nmap, think of it like a radar for networks. It scans devices on a network and tells you which ones are online, what services they are running, and other useful details. It is mostly used for network auditing.

Wireshark, like a microscope for network traffic. It captures and analyzes the data going in and out of your computer, helping you understand what is happening on your network.

Metasploit, a toolbox for security testing. It helps security professionals find vulnerabilities in systems and test how they can be exploited, only with permission.

Burp Suite, a security scanner for websites. It tests web applications to find weak points where hackers might break in.

John the Ripper, a password tester. It tries to crack passwords by testing many combinations. It is useful for checking password strength, again only with permission.

EXE File â€“ Simple Explanation

EXE stands for Executable File.

It is a type of file used in Windows to run programs.

When you double-click an EXE file, Windows follows the instructions inside it to open the program.

Examples: opening notepad.exe runs Notepad; chrome.exe runs Google Chrome.

An EXE file is like a recipe that your computer follows to make the program appear and work.

Be careful, because EXE files can also contain harmful instructions. You should only run them if you trust the source.
